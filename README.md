Digital biomarkers are digitally collected data that are transformed into indicators of health outcomes. The BIG IDEAS Lab is developing digital biomarkers for a range of diseases and conditions using a variety of sensors. 

The purpose of the Digital Biomarker Discovery Pipeline is to provide code sets and functions to enable everyone to explore digital biomarkers. We will be updating the DBDP periodically with different components of the Digital Biomarker Discovery process.
